      -----------------------------------------------------------
      SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
      -----------------------------------------------------------

      PREAMBLE
      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
      development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
      efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
      open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
      with others.

      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
      redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
      fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
      redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
      names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
      however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
      requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
      to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

      DEFINITIONS
      "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
      Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
      include source files, build scripts and documentation.

      "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
      copyright statement(s).

      "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
      distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

      "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
      or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
      Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
      new environment.
 
      "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
      writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

      PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
      Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
      a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
      redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
      Software, subject to the following conditions:

      1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
      in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

      2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
      redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
      contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
      included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
      in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
      binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

      3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
      Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
      Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
      presented to the users.

      4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
      Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
      Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
      Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
      permission.

      5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
      must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
      distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
      remain under this license does not apply to any document created
      using the Font Software.

      TERMINATION
      This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
      not met.

      DISCLAIMER
      THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
